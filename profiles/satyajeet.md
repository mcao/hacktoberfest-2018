Compact Paper Recycling machine
Apr 2017 – Present

Project descriptionWe are working on a compact model of Paper Recycling Machine which we have thought of to install in various Colleges and working institutions across the globe, Any used and unessential paper sheets can be put on this machine for recycling and you can get a new sheet of A4 size paper in a matter of seconds. 
Also, we have decided to keep this as cost-effective as possible and also keeping it handy so that it can be used in offices with ease.

### Projects


Project namePotholes Detector cum Locator for Road Safety (Road Inspector)
Jul 2018 – Present

Project descriptionAs of now, Google maps shows the traffic density and time required for travel to the destination.
But, it gives no information about the quality of a path. Neither is there any other portal which
gives that information about obstacle(Potholes) density of a particular road. We have prepared an app that will take the accelerometer readings to detect the potholes and send it to neared municipalities or people concerned with road wualit of that area.
