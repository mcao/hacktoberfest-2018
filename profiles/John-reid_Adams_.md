### Location

Cape Town, South Africa

### Academics

Currently a High School Student. I also attended a class for basic robotics and will attend an advanced class soon.

### Interests

Everything that can be learned and is related to computers and tech itself. It's something I uncontrollably geek about.

### Development 

Not much worth to say. I have programmed a robot to move through a maze and had it "dance".

### Projects 

I am still new but plan to contribute to projects very soon.
