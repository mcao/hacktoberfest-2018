### Location

bangkok, Thailand

### Academics

Current high school student. Also attends specialized high school for programming and information technology.

### Interests

I love to play soccer, although that's not exactly relevant. I also like to write my own little apps do to small things for me, like typing a test message every 12 seconds.

### Development

Nothing relevant; I haven't done any large projects. However, I've created a very basic voice assistant using a Raspberry Pi.

### Projects

I've posted my answers to competition programs, like ACSL, after the competition ended. See my profile for more detail.
